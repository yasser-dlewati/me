# My personal website code.
it contains a couple of photos of me, and Yasser in a couple of lines, and some ways to reach me out.

NOTES:
- The carousel slider you see, is a custom one built by me from the ground up.
- The function behind sending the email is using a smtpjs library.
- I used the Snackbar instead of Toast notifications.
- The template used to build my website can be found at https://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page289/ben-resume
